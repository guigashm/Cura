[2.1.0]

*2.1 Beta release
Cura has been completely reengineered from the ground up for an even more seamless integration between hardware, software and materials. Together with its intuitive new user interface, it’s now also ready for any future developments. For the beginner, Cura makes 3D printing incredibly easy, and for more advanced users, there are over 140 new customisable settings.

*Select Multiple Objects
You now have the freedom to select and manipulate multiple objects at the same time.

*Grouping
You can now group objects together to make it easier to manipulate multiple objects.

*Undo/Redo
You can now undo and redo your actions, like moving an object or scaling.

*Setting Profiles
The new GUI allows custom profiles to load easily and intuitively, directly from Cura.

*3MF File Loading Support
We’re happy to report we now support loading 3MF files. This is a new file format similar to AMF, but freely available.

*Intuitive Cut-Off Object Bottom 
We’ve added a feature that allows you to move objects below the build plate. You can either correct a model with a rough bottom, or print only a part of an object. Please note that the implementation differs greatly from the old one when it was just a setting.

*64-bit Windows Builds 
An optimized 64-bit Windows Cura version is now available. This allows you to load larger model files.

*Automatic calculations
Cura allows you to set a number of lines/layers instead of millimeters. The engine automatically calculates the right settings.

*Per-Object Settings
You can now override individual settings for different objects in advanced mode.

*Fuzzy Skin
Prints the outer walls with a jittering motion to give your object a diffused finish.

*Wire Printing
The object is printed with a mid-air / net-like structure, following the mesh surface. The build plate will move up and down during diagonal segments. Though not visible in layer view, you can view the result in other software, such as Repetier Host or http://chilipeppr.com/tinyg.

* Conical Support
An experimental filament, cost-reduction feature, for support.

*Support Towers
Specialized support for tiny overhang areas.

*ZigZag infill
A new, infill type that’s easily breakable, introduced specially for support.

* Avoid Printed Parts
While combing, the print head moves around printed parts, avoiding collisions with the nozzle and a part that’s already printed.
